MDS assessments are completed for all residents in certified nursing homes, regardless of source of payment for the individual resident. MDS assessments are required for residents on admission to the nursing facility, periodically, and on discharge. All assessments are completed within specific guidelines and time frames. In most cases, participants in the assessment process are licensed health care professionals employed by the nursing home. MDS information is transmitted electronically by nursing homes to the national MDS database at CMS.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen reviewing the MDS 3.0 Frequency files, some common software programs e.g., \u2018Microsoft Excel\u2019 might inaccurately strip leading zeros from designated code values (i.e., \"01\" becomes \"1\") or misinterpret code ranges as dates (i.e., O0600 ranges such as 02-04 are misread as 04-Feb).
